Hi Bob,

I wanted to follow up on our conversation about the Q1 planning session. I've compiled the following key points:

1. Timeline - We need to finalize by February
2. Budget - Waiting on finance approval
3. Resources - Team capacity looks good

Let me know your thoughts and if you have any concerns.

Best regards,
Alice

Alice,

Great summary! I've reviewed your points and I have the following feedback:

Timeline looks feasible. However, I'd like to push the first milestone to Feb 5th instead of Feb 1st to allow for proper QA testing. This shouldn't impact the overall Q1 goals.

Budget-wise, I'll reach out to finance today and see if we can expedite their review.

I'll send the meeting invitation shortly.

Thanks,
Bob

Both,

Count me in for the planning session. I'll have the technical requirements document ready by end of week.

One question - have we considered the integration with the legacy system? I want to make sure we account for the compatibility layer that was discussed in December.

Looking forward to the meeting.
